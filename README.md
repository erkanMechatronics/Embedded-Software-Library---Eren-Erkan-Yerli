This repository is divided into two parts:

1. Peripheral Learning:
Examples and practice files to learn the peripherals of the STM32F407VG microcontroller, including GPIO, TIMER, PWM, ADC, DAC, DMA, FLASH, EXTI, RTC, UART, SPI, I2C, and CANBUS. It also includes examples for understanding FreeRTOS and its features.

2. Projects:
A collection of projects where I apply my knowledge of peripherals and FreeRTOS to develop functional applications.

This repository reflects my learning journey and showcases my skills as I prepare for my first role as a Junior Embedded Software Engineer.

Feel free to explore, and any feedback is welcome!
